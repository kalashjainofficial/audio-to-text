Audio & Video Transcription with Whisper
This project uses OpenAI Whisper
 to transcribe audio and video files into text.
It scans a folder for supported media files and saves their transcriptions into a text file.
Supports dozens of audio & video formats (.mp3, .wav, .mp4, .mkv, .flac, etc.).
Automatically scans a given folder (and subfolders).
Saves results to a single text file (converted text.txt), with filenames included.
